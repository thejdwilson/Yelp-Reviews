# Yelp-Reviews
This is a simple Flask app that pulls restaurant reviews from the Yelp Fusion API

# How to use
If you decide to run this locally you will need to generate your own application in the Yelp API and supply your token for the "Authorization: Bearer Token" section

You can (temporarily) view this at http://13.59.211.74:5000/reviews?id=GEuow-XQTe9JC8S03mk7kg

You can generate a different restaurant id through the Fusion API. The one I am using is for Allyn's Cafe in Cincinnati, OH
